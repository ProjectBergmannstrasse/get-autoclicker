# autoclicker-universal.py  v5.6
# One file for Windows, macOS and Linux — it detects which at
# runtime. Single-platform builds: autoclicker-windows.py /
# autoclicker-macos.py
# Dependencies install themselves on first run — nothing to type.
# (manual fallback:  pip3 install --user textual pynput requests pyperclip)

v5.6 changes vs v5.5:
  - RECORDER no longer records clicks that land on this app's own window.
    Pressing STOP with the mouse was captured like any other click, so
    replaying the macro walked the pointer back here and clicked whatever
    was under it - STOP again, or a wallet copy pill, which silently
    replaced the clipboard with a crypto address mid-macro.
    macOS never showed it because Esc stops recording there before any
    click happens; on Windows you click the button.
      * Textual delivers mouse events only when the click hit us, so those
        are exact markers - the matching recorded clicks are removed.
      * A trailing click at the very end is dropped too, for the release
        that arrives after the listener is gone.
      * Recordings saved before this fix are trimmed when they load, so
        existing macros stop doing it without being re-recorded.

v5.5 changes vs v5.4:
  - WINDOWS HOTKEYS:
      * F8 = start/stop, F9 = pause/resume. Tapping Alt alone activates the
        menu bar of the focused window on Windows, so the Alt hotkeys were
        popping menus in the target app. F8/F9 don't.
      * AltGr is now recognised. On UK/German/French/Nordic/Polish layouts
        the right Alt reports as Key.alt_gr, not Key.alt_r, so both-Alt
        pause and single right-Alt did nothing at all on those keyboards.
      * The synthetic Ctrl that Windows fires alongside AltGr no longer
        cancels a legitimate Alt tap.

v5.3 changes vs v5.2:
  - AUTO-INSTALL bootstrap: detects missing packages, asks permission,
    installs them behind a live progress UI, then starts normally.
      * pure-stdlib UI (runs before textual/rich exist)
      * venv aware; --user by default; PEP-668 / --break-system-packages
        and no---user fallbacks; ensurepip when pip itself is missing
      * flags: --yes  --no-install  --setup  --no-perms
  - PERMISSION GATE: macOS Accessibility + Input Monitoring are checked via
    ctypes, with a native grant prompt and one-key deep links into
    System Settings; Windows elevation hint; Linux Wayland warning.
  - Remembers declined optional packages so it never nags twice.

v5.2 changes vs v5.1:
  - Tabs: MAIN · COMMANDS · HISTORY · FEEDBACK · SETTINGS · INFO
  - Esc bar SHRINKS smoothly (a width-animated progress bar, not a static block)
  - Esc behavior:
      tap 1 = arm 3-second window
      tap 2 within window = PAUSE / RESUME
      tap 3 within window = QUIT
  - Settings tab:
      esc warning style:  GUI bar  OR  fullscreen takeover (separate window)
      warning emoji:      user-editable (default ⚠️)
  - Fullscreen takeover via separate tkinter subprocess (esc_overlay.py)
  - Mini mode resizes the host terminal window (AppleScript on macOS,
    ANSI + mode con on Windows, ANSI elsewhere)
  - Hotkeys: F8 start/stop · F9 pause · Alt tap · both Alts · Esc x3 quit
